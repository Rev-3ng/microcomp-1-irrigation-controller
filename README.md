A 7-station irrigation controller using the Talking Electronics microcomp-1 Z80 Single Board Computer.

Back in 1996 I purchased a Talking Electronics microcomp-1 Z80 based single board computer. I added an interface and power supply to it to control up to 7 irrigation solenoid-valves over 4-wire telephone cable.
The controller featured a day-of-the-week display, station rundown timer, crude time-of-the-day tracking using a pair of LDR's (Light Dependant Resistors) and a rain sensor made from vero strip board to switch off the controller in the event of rain.

The microcomp-1 does not have any RAM or an RTC, so programming it as timed irrigation controller that tracks days and time crudely was an 'interesting' programming challenge.

The program was setup to comply with local water restrictions at the time which limited what days of the week and times were allowed for watering lawns and gardens.

I used this controller for about 7 years from Dec 1996 through to Dec 2003 when I moved, where my new rental residence already had a commercial irrigation controller installed, so this project was no longer required.
